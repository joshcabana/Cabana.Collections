CABANA Collections – Claim Hygiene Notes

Context: Align copy with ACCC guidance on environmental/green claims and charity representations. This file documents what we changed and why.

Edits made

- Environmental biodegradability claims:
  - Replaced “100% Biodegradable” with: “Modal‑rich fabric (95% modal / 5% elastane). The modal fibre is biodegradable; the elastane component is not.”
  - Rationale: Avoid absolute claims. Elastane is a synthetic polymer and not biodegradable under typical conditions.

- “No microplastics” style claims:
  - Removed “0 microplastics/no microplastics”. Added care guidance footnote: “Wash with a microfibre bag to help reduce fibre shedding.”
  - Rationale: Avoid unqualified absolutes; fibre shedding varies by conditions and wash practices.

- “Returns completely to nature”:
  - Removed and replaced with factual modal/elastane statement and care guidance.

- Country of origin:
  - Replaced “Made in Australia” with: “Designed in Australia. Responsibly made in [COUNTRY].”
  - TODO: Replace [COUNTRY] with verified manufacturing country once confirmed in supply documentation.

- Partners → Organisations we support:
  - Terminology aligned where there is no executed partnership agreement and public reporting.

Charity/impact phrasing

- Standard line used site‑wide: “10% of every purchase supports men’s mental health & women’s empowerment.”
- Added Transparency page link to detail methodology and future quarterly summaries/receipts.

TODOs

- Confirm manufacturing country and replace the [COUNTRY] placeholder.
- Add quarterly JSON/receipts to the Transparency page when available.
